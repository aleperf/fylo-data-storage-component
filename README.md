The Fylo Data Storage Component is a responsive element with a menu for managing files and a section  showing the storage left for an account of the fictional storage company Fylo.

The component is realized using only HTML, CSS and SASS.


The original design is from the  [Fylo Data Storage Component Frontend Mentor Challenge. ](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n)

The project is deployed on my Github pages [here.](https://aleperf.github.io/fylo-data-storage-component/)
