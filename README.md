The Fylo Data Storage Component shows a responsive element, with a menu for managing files and the storage left for an account of the fictional storage company Fylo.

The component is realized using only HTML, CSS and SASS.


The original design is from the  [Fylo Data Storage Component Frontend Mentor Challenge. ](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n)

The project is deployed on my Github pages [here.](https://aleperf.github.io/fylo-data-storage-component/)
